# AngularRecruitmentTask


Junior angular developer was tasked to create a view that consists of two parts.
 
The first part of the task has two panels, the left one displays the even numbers and the right one the odd numbers. If the displayed number is divisible by 5, it should be displayed in red.
 
The second part of the task is the list of employees. User should have a possibility to add a new employee to the list.

Code is far from perfection, consists a lot of anti-patterns. 
Your task is to review the code, explain to the junior where he made a mistakes and what is the best approach to write it in the right way.
